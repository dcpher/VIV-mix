      <h3>Motorbikes in Bali</h3>

      <p>It's one of the most popular overseas holiday spots for Australians - it's cheap to get there and the warm temperatures, wide variety of accommodation, well-priced food

        <p>At TID we get lots of questions about coverage for riding motorbikes and we receive plenty of claims from customers who get Bali belly and even dengue fever. Make sure
        you read our advice for travellers to Bali and when you buy your insurance you'll get our free Tripwise app with even more tips for travelling to Bali.</p>
